Instructor:
: [Rajiv Gandhi](mailto:rajivg100@gmail.com)

Teaching Assistants:
: [Course staff](staff.html)

Discussion Forum:
: [Piazza](https://piazza.com/upenn/spring2016/cis121/)

Time and place:
: Lectures are Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10:30 in Towne 100

Prerequisites:
: [CIS 120](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis120/) and [CIS 160](http://www.thepigeonholeprinciple.com)

Textbook:

: The lectures and readings will be based off of
[Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd edition](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-Thomas-Cormen/dp/0262033844/).
It is strongly recommended that you buy this textbook for the readings. It is available from the Penn Bookstore, as well as various online retailers.

Grading:

: The grading for the course will consist of:

    * 40% for homework assignments and the final project
    * 15% each for 2 midterm exams
    * 25% for the final
    * 5% for recitation attendance. Recitation attendance is mandatory.

Late submission policy:

: The following applies to all homeworks, both written and programming, except
for the final project, which does not have a late day policy. Homeworks can be
submitted at most two days late. Each student has two free, no-strings-attached
"late days". If you submit late and you have late days remaining, then you will
not incur the late penalty that corresponds to the number of late days used. If
you are out of late days, then you will incur a 25% penalty off the total
possible number of points on the homework for each day late. One "day" is
defined as anytime between 1 second and 24 hours after the homework deadline,
Late written homeworks can be turned in to Laura Fox in Levine 308. The final
project does not have the same late policy; it has its own late policy, which
will be announced with its release.

Collaboration policy for written homeworks:

: You are allowed to discuss solutions to problems in groups of three,
*documenting* who you discussed with at the top of your assignment. You are
allowed to ask anyone for LaTeX help (for instance, "How do I center a stack of
equations?"). You are **not** allowed to write up the solutions together. You
must do that by yourself.

Collaboration policy for programming homeworks:

: You are allowed to discuss low-level issues like the meaning of Java
constructs, or how to use the computing environment. You are allowed to discuss
high-level questions such as what the instructor/lab TA said, the content of the
textbook or other general resources. You **not** allowed to...

    -   Discuss issues directly pertaining to the homework questions or
        their solutions.
    -   See another students homework solutions, or
    -   Show your solutions to another student
        -   This includes asking a classmate to debug your code and agreeing
            to debug a classmate’s code. If you do this during office hours,
            know that the TAs are *required* to report your names to the
            instructor.
    -   Share any code except the code that is being made available by us on
        the course website to be used specifically with your solutions
        -   Occasionally, a *small* snippet of code *from the textbook* may help
            your work. You can use such a snippet *with attribution*, i.e.,
            provided you add a comment in which you make clear you copied it
            from the textbook.
        -   You may NOT use snippets of code from the Internet (e.g.,
            StackOverflow.com and similar).
        -   You may NOT share test cases.
    -   Post your code where it may be accessible to others. This is largely a
        clarification of the previous rule. This means that you may NOT seek help
        from online forums, like StackOverflow or similar. You may NOT push your
        code to a public repository like GitHub (private repositories, however, are
        permitted). You may seek help from online forums for low-level issues as mentioned above. 
        When in doubt, ask on Piazza.
    -   Look at other people’s information
        -   If you find a terminal on which somebody else has logged in and
            forgot to log out, you *must* log them out
        -   When somebody else is typing a password in front of you *must*
            look out the window, or at your shoes, or at the picture of Brad
            Pitt or Angelina Jolie that you carry on your keychain.
    -   Use any code downloaded from the Internet or sent to you by email,
        Facebook, text, Twitter, or even scribbled notes passed from hand to
        hand :)
    -   Share the material that we post for this course with anybody who is
        not a registered student in this course or a staff member.
        -   If you find any such material already posted somewhere else you
            *must* inform the course staff immediately. Same if you are
            contacted by people who offer to solve your homework for money,
            or who knows what else. Use your common sense and ask any member
            of the staff if you are not sure about a resource you are
            considering.
        -   You may NOT share course materials without the prior approval of the
            course staff. You may NOT post course materials on sites such as
            CourseHero. This infringes upon the copyright of materials authored by
            the course staff.

Any violation of the collaboration policy will be dealt with severely.

Regrade policy for programming homeworks:
: We allow you to indicate *small errors* (defined below) that you have made,
    which, when fixed, will allow your programs to pass autograder tests. You
    will need to send an email, by the regrade deadline, which is one week after
    you receive your scores, to
    [cis121-16sp-staff@googlegroups.com](mailto:cis121-16sp-staff@googlegroups.com).
    This email must identify exactly the error in your code and include a
    precise description of the fix that needs to be made. A *small error* is a
    problem whose fix should not require changing more than 1--2 lines of code.
    A TA will make the change and rerun the autograder tests, or you may attach the 
    revised file and we will compare the submissions. Your new score
    will be the maximum of your original score and 80% of your regraded score.
    What are some acceptable/common types of "small" errors?

    - Use of `==` instead of `.equals`
    - Modification of a method header, causing compilation failure
    - Lack or addition of `!` operators

    Regrade emails to individual TAs are NOT guaranteed to be processed.


Regrade policy for written homeworks and exams:

: Each written assignment and each midterm exam will have a regrade request
deadline that will be posted typically one week after the assignment or exam has
been returned with your score. Beyond that deadline, regrades can only be given
by permission of the instructor. Regrade requests are meant for cases such as
arithmetic mistakes in tabulating a final score, or for a grader not seeing that
you continued your solution on the back of the page (as an example). In the
interest of transparency, the course staff makes its best effort to indicate
exactly where points are docked with the associated reasons. For the written
assignments and for the midterms, solutions will be provided in class. Please
consult these carefully before requesting a regrade. Please fill out the
[regrade request form](content/hws/regrade_request_16sp.pdf) and bring it to the
course administrator, Laura Fox, in Levine 308, together with the assignment or
exam by the regrade deadline.
